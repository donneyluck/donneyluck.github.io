* Hi and welcome to my blog :)


  I would tell you what kind of posts you can find here, but let's face it:
  I take pleasure in playing with and modifying my blogging setup
  (Emacs + org-mode â™¥), but not so much in actually writing blog posts.

  So instead I'll tell you what I *plan* to write about here:
  
  - Game programming stuff: Game server, network ( c, lua, c++, c#, rust, golang )...

  - Personal stuff: Linux on "unusual" devicess, terminal apps no one needs...

  - Emacs stuff

  - Linux stuff: reviews of linux distros I tried( manjaro...)
                 @@html:<br>@@window managers( i3wm... )
                 @@html:<br>@@terminal emulators...

  You'll find all that stuff when you click on [[./archive.html][stuff]] (that is, *if* I can ever bring myself to write).
